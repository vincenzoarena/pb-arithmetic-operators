**Basic Arithmetic Problems**
​
Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold? 
​
Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?
​
**Percentage**
​
Q3. Calculate the percentage of 18/30. 
​
`Expected output: 60%`

`Given 2 numbers "a" and "b", to calculate the percentage of one number in relation to the other the formula is: (a / b) * 100`
​
**Geometry Formulas** 
​
Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.
​
`The perimeter of a square is the length of each side summed together.`
​
Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.
​
Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.
​
Q7. Calculate the area of an [right-angled triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle). Assume the length of the sides are 3cm, 4cm, 5cm.
​
Q8. Calculate the volume of a cube. Length of each side is 9cm.
​
**Consumer Formula**
​
Q9. Calculate the three bills including tips:
€22.35 + 10% tip
€26.67 + 15% tip
€35.92 + 20% tip
​
```
To calculate the percentage of a number:
​
1. divide the percentage amount by 100
2. multiply your number by the result of step 1
​
For example, the 15% of 30:
​
- divide 15 by 100: 15 / 100, which gives 0.15
- multiply 30 by 0.15: 30 * 0.15
```
​
**Average** 
​
Q10. The number of hours Noemy worked over the last two weeks are 8, 6, 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, 8.5, 7, 4
What is Noemy's average hours worked per day?
​
```
The average of a series of number is calculate by summing all the numbers 
together and dividing the result by how many numbers you have
